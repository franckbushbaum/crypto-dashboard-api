# Cryptop Dashboard app using React/Node.js:
*This project is simply to practice APIs, I won't dedicate any time to styling*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## APIs used:

- [Alpha Vantage API](https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage/) for the currency exchange rates.
- [Crypto News Live](https://rapidapi.com/ddeshon/api/crypto-news-live3/) for the news articles.
